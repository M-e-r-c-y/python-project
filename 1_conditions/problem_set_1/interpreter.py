# Math Interpreter
Instruction:
- prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then 
- calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. 
- Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, 
    wherein:
        x is an integer
        y is +, -, *, or /
        z is an integer
    - For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. 
    - Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.

*Note that, just as python itself is an interpreter for Python, so will your interpreter.py be an interpreter for math!
